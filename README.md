# Data_Mining_and_Machine_Learning
This project involves the analysis and modeling of two distinct datasetsâ€”one for classification and another for regression. The goal is to perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), address missing data, apply proper preprocessing techniques, and then build predictive models using both clustering and regression.
